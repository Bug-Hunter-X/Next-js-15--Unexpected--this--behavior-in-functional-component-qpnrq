# Next.js 15: Unexpected 'this' behavior in functional component

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered in Next.js 15 applications related to the use of the `this` keyword within functional components.  In this version, functional components do not have their own `this` context, resulting in errors when attempting to access it directly.

## Bug Description
The code in `pages/about.js` attempts to access `this`, which is undefined in functional components. This leads to a runtime error.

## Solution
The solution involves removing the attempt to use `this` or replacing the function with a class component if `this` context is absolutely required.  The revised `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates a correct approach.
